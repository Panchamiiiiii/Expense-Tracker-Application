1. Develop a Python Application that will help users track their expenses and
savings goals.
Requirements
● Users can log their daily expenses
● Expenses are categorized (e.g., "Food," "Transport," "Entertainment").
● Users can set monthly budgets for each category.
● The system alerts users if they exceed their budget for the category.
 Basic Reports
● Show Total spending per month
● Compare spending vs budget per category
If all this seems too easy, extra credit will be given for:
● Allowing users to have different budgets for different months
● Custom alerts, example: alert user when only 10% budget is left
● Email notifications to user for alert
● Allowing users to share expenses, amongst a group (think Splitwise)
